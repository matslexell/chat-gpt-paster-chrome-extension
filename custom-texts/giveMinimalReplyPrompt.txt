Hi ChatGPT,
I have a coding problem that I need your assistance with. I'm going to provide a description of the issue and a relevant code block for context. Please only suggest the minimal changes necessary to address the problem instead of rewriting the whole code block. To clarify: You usually give verbose examples where you rewrite a lot of code, even parts that doesn't require edits: I DO NOT WANT YOU TO DO THIS, Please provide the smallest possible change to fix the issue I'm about to describe.

Here's the issue:

And here's the code block:
